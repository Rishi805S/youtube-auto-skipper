## üéØ **Feature Testing Checklist**

### **1. Segment Memory & Learning System**
**What to test:** The extension learns your preferences and remembers your actions

**How to test:**
- Press `Alt + M` to see memory stats
- Skip a few sponsor segments manually
- Reload the page - extension should remember your preferences
- Check console for: `[SponsorSkip Debug] Memory service initialized`

**Expected behavior:**
- After 5+ skips of same category, it auto-adds to skip list
- Stats show learning is ON and action count increases

---

### **2. Performance Optimizations**
**What to test:** Efficient segment processing and caching

**How to test:**
- Press `Alt + P` to see performance stats
- Watch multiple videos to see caching in action
- Check console for: `[SponsorSkip Debug] Segments optimized`

**Expected behavior:**
- Cache size increases as you watch videos
- Segment processing shows "original vs optimized" counts
- Memory usage displayed in KB

---

### **3. Mute Option Instead of Skip**
**What to test:** Some segments get muted instead of skipped

**How to test:**

- Try clicking "Skip", "Mute", or "Keep" buttons

**Expected behavior:**
- Preview shows segment category and duration
- 5-second countdown with progress bar
- Auto-skips if no choice made

---

### **5. Visual Progress Bar Markers**
**What to test:** Colored segments on YouTube progress bar

**How to test:**

- Hover over colored segments
- Check different segment categories

**Expected behavior:**
- Red segments = sponsors
- Orange segments = self-promotion
- Purple segments = interaction reminders
- Tooltips show category and duration

---

### **6. Enhanced Notifications**
**What to test:** Better notifications with emojis and categories

**How to test:**

- Mini-player compatible notifications

---

### **7. Keyboard Shortcuts**
**What to test:** All keyboard controls work

**Shortcuts to test:**
- `Alt + S` - Toggle on/off
- `Alt + D` - Show detailed stats
- `Alt + M` - Show memory/learning stats  
- `Alt + P` - Show performance stats

**Expected behavior:**
- Each shortcut shows appropriate notification

---

### **8. Cross-Device Sync**
**What to test:** Preferences sync across browser instances

**How to test:**
- Set up preferences in one browser

- Check if preferences transferred

**Expected behavior:**
- Auto-skip categories sync
- Learning preferences sync
- User actions may not sync (stored locally)

---

## üîç **Debug Console Commands**

Open DevTools Console and try these:

```javascript
// Check if services are loaded
window.sponsorSkipDebug = {
  memory: SegmentMemoryService.getInstance(),
  performance: PerformanceService.getInstance()
};

// Get current preferences
console.log(await window.sponsorSkipDebug.memory.getPreferences());

// Get cache stats
console.log(window.sponsorSkipDebug.performance.getCacheStats());
```

---

## üé¨ **Test Video Recommendations**

**Good test videos with sponsor segments:**
1. Tech review videos (usually have sponsors)
2. Gaming videos (often have self-promotion)
3. Tutorial videos (interaction reminders)

**Look for these in console:**
- `[SponsorSkip Debug] Enhanced Skipper created`
- `[SponsorSkip Debug] Segments loaded`
